# 2966. Divide Array Into Arrays With Max Difference

# You are given an integer array nums of size n where n is a multiple of 3 and a positive integer k.

# Divide the array nums into n / 3 arrays of size 3 satisfying the following condition:

# The difference between any two elements in one array is less than or equal to k.
# Return a 2D array containing the arrays. If it is impossible to satisfy the conditions, return an empty array. And if there are multiple answers, return any of them.

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [1,3,4,8,7,9,3,5,1], k = 2

# Output: [[1,1,3],[3,4,5],[7,8,9]]

# Explanation:

# The difference between any two elements in each array is less than or equal to 2.

# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [2,4,2,2,5,2], k = 2

# Output: []

# Explanation:

# Different ways to divide nums into 2 arrays of size 3 are:

# [[2,2,2],[2,4,5]] (and its permutations)
# [[2,2,4],[2,2,5]] (and its permutations)
# Because there are four 2s there will be an array with the elements 2 and 5 no matter how we divide it. since 5 - 2 = 3 > k, the condition is not satisfied and so there is no valid division.

# Example 3:

# Input: nums = [4,2,9,8,2,12,7,12,10,5,8,5,5,7,9,2,5,11], k = 14

# Output: [[2,2,12],[4,8,5],[5,9,7],[7,8,5],[5,9,10],[11,12,2]]

# Explanation:

# The difference between any two elements in each array is less than or equal to 14.

# Constraints:

# n == nums.length
# 1 <= n <= 105
# n is a multiple of 3
# 1 <= nums[i] <= 105
# 1 <= k <= 105
