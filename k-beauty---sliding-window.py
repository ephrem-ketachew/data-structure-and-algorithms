# 2269. Find the K-Beauty of a Number
# Easy
# The k-beauty of an integer num is defined as the number of substrings of num when it is read as a string that meet the following conditions:

# It has a length of k.
# It is a divisor of num.
# Given integers num and k, return the k-beauty of num.

# Note:
# Leading zeros are allowed.
# 0 is not a divisor of any value.
# A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.

# Example 1:

# Input: num = 240, k = 2
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The following are the substrings of num of length k:
# - "24" from "240": 24 is a divisor of 240.
# - "40" from "240": 40 is a divisor of 240.
# Therefore, the k-beauty is 2.
# Example 2:

# Input: num = 430043, k = 2
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The following are the substrings of num of length k:
# - "43" from "430043": 43 is a divisor of 430043.
# - "30" from "430043": 30 is not a divisor of 430043.
# - "00" from "430043": 0 is not a divisor of 430043.
# - "04" from "430043": 4 is not a divisor of 430043.
# - "43" from "430043": 43 is a divisor of 430043.
# Therefore, the k-beauty is 2.

# Constraints:

# 1 <= num <= 109
# 1 <= k <= num.length (taking num as a string)

class Solution:
    def divisorSubstrings(self, num: int, k: int) -> int:
        k_beauty = 0
        
        str_num = str(num)
        
        for i in range(len(str_num) - k + 1):
            n = int(str_num[i:i+k])
            if n and num % n == 0:
                k_beauty += 1
                
        return k_beauty
