# 771. Jewels and Stones
# You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

# Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".
# Example 1:

# Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
# Output: 3
# Example 2:

# Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"
# Output: 0

class Solution:
    def numJewelsInStones(self, jewels: str, stones: str) -> int:
        # return sum(1 if char in jewels else 0 for char in stones)
        return sum(char in jewels for char in stones)
