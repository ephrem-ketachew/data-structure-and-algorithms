# Q1. Coupon Code Validator
# Easy
# 3 pt.
# You are given three arrays of length n that describe the properties of n coupons: code, businessLine, and isActive. The ith coupon has:

# code[i]: a string representing the coupon identifier.
# businessLine[i]: a string denoting the business category of the coupon.
# isActive[i]: a boolean indicating whether the coupon is currently active.
# A coupon is considered valid if all of the following conditions hold:

# code[i] is non-empty and consists only of alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and underscores (_).
# businessLine[i] is one of the following four categories: "electronics", "grocery", "pharmacy", "restaurant".
# isActive[i] is true.
# Return an array of the codes of all valid coupons, sorted first by their businessLine in the order: "electronics", "grocery", "pharmacy", "restaurant", and then by code in lexicographical (ascending) order within each category.

# Example 1:

# Input: code = ["SAVE20","","PHARMA5","SAVE@20"], businessLine = ["restaurant","grocery","pharmacy","restaurant"], isActive = [true,true,true,true]

# Output: ["PHARMA5","SAVE20"]

# Explanation:

# First coupon is valid.
# Second coupon has empty code (invalid).
# Third coupon is valid.
# Fourth coupon has special character @ (invalid).
# Example 2:

# Input: code = ["GROCERY15","ELECTRONICS_50","DISCOUNT10"], businessLine = ["grocery","electronics","invalid"], isActive = [false,true,true]

# Output: ["ELECTRONICS_50"]

# Explanation:

# First coupon is inactive (invalid).
# Second coupon is valid.
# Third coupon has invalid business line (invalid).

# Constraints:

# n == code.length == businessLine.length == isActive.length
# 1 <= n <= 100
# 0 <= code[i].length, businessLine[i].length <= 100
# code[i] and businessLine[i] consist of printable ASCII characters.
# isActive[i] is either true or false.Â©leetcode
