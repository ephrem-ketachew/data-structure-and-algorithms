# A. Perfect Root
# time limit per test1 second

# A positive integer x
#  is a perfect root if there exists an integer y
#  such that y√=x
# . For example, 5
#  is a perfect root because 25−−√=5
# .

# For each test case, output n
#  distinct perfect roots. Note that the values only need to be distinct within each test case; you can use the same value in different test cases.

# Input
# The first line of the input contains a single integer t
#  (1≤t≤20
# ) — the number of test cases.

# The only line of each test case contains an integer n
#  (1≤n≤20
# ) — the number of perfect roots to output.

# Output
# For each test case, output n
#  distinct perfect roots. Each perfect root x
#  must be in the range 1≤x≤109
# .

# Note
# For the first test case:

# 1
#  is a perfect root because 1–√=1
# .
# For the second test case:

# 2
#  is a perfect root because 4–√=2

# 4
#  is a perfect root because 16−−√=4
