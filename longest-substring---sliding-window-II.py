# 2982. Find Longest Special Substring That Occurs Thrice II
# Medium

# You are given a string s that consists of lowercase English letters.

# A string is called special if it is made up of only a single character. For example, the string "abc" is not special, whereas the strings "ddd", "zz", and "f" are special.

# Return the length of the longest special substring of s which occurs at least thrice, or -1 if no special substring occurs at least thrice.

# A substring is a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a string.

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "aaaa"
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The longest special substring which occurs thrice is "aa": substrings "aaaa", "aaaa", and "aaaa".
# It can be shown that the maximum length achievable is 2.
# Example 2:

# Input: s = "abcdef"
# Output: -1
# Explanation: There exists no special substring which occurs at least thrice. Hence return -1.
# Example 3:

# Input: s = "abcaba"
# Output: 1
# Explanation: The longest special substring which occurs thrice is "a": substrings "abcaba", "abcaba", and "abcaba".
# It can be shown that the maximum length achievable is 1.
 
# Constraints:

# 3 <= s.length <= 5 * 105
# s consists of only lowercase English letters.
