# Eralim, being the mafia boss, manages a group of n
#  fighters. Fighter i
#  has a rating of ai
# .

# Eralim arranges a tournament of n−1
#  battles, in each of which two not yet eliminated fighters i
#  and j
#  (1≤i<j≤n
# ) are chosen, and as a result of the battle, fighter i
#  is eliminated from the tournament, and the rating of fighter j
#  is reduced by the rating of fighter i
# . That is, aj
#  is decreased by ai
# . Note that fighter j
# 's rating can become negative. The fighters indexes do not change.

# Eralim wants to know what maximum rating the last remaining fighter can preserve if he chooses the battles optimally.

# Input
# Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t
#  (1≤t≤104
# ). The description of the test cases follows.

# The first line of each test case contains a single integer n
#  (2≤n≤2⋅105
# ) — the number of fighters.

# The second line of each test case contains n
#  integers a1,a2,…an
#  (1≤ai≤109
# ) — the ratings of the fighters.

# The sum of n
#  over all testcases does not exceed 2⋅105
# .

# Output
# For each testcase, output a single integer — the maximum rating that the last remaining fighter can preserve.

# Note
# In the first example, you can arrange a fight between fighters with indices 1
#  and 2
# , where the fighter with index 2
#  will win. The rating of the last fighter, that is, the fighter with index 2
# , will be 1−2=−1
# .

# In the second example, you can first conduct a fight between fighters with indices 1
#  and 2
# , where the fighter with index 2
#  will win, and then conduct a fight between fighters with indices 2
#  and 3
# , where the fighter with index 3
#  will win.

# The rating of the fighter with index 2
#  after the first fight will be 2−2=0
# . The rating of the fighter with index 3
#  after the second fight will be 8−0=8
