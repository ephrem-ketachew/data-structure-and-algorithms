# 3342. Find Minimum Time to Reach Last Room II
# Medium

# There is a dungeon with n x m rooms arranged as a grid.

# You are given a 2D array moveTime of size n x m, where moveTime[i][j] represents the minimum time in seconds when you can start moving to that room. You start from the room (0, 0) at time t = 0 and can move to an adjacent room. Moving between adjacent rooms takes one second for one move and two seconds for the next, alternating between the two.

# Return the minimum time to reach the room (n - 1, m - 1).

# Two rooms are adjacent if they share a common wall, either horizontally or vertically.

# Example 1:

# Input: moveTime = [[0,4],[4,4]]

# Output: 7

# Explanation:

# The minimum time required is 7 seconds.

# At time t == 4, move from room (0, 0) to room (1, 0) in one second.
# At time t == 5, move from room (1, 0) to room (1, 1) in two seconds.
# Example 2:

# Input: moveTime = [[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0]]

# Output: 6

# Explanation:

# The minimum time required is 6 seconds.

# At time t == 0, move from room (0, 0) to room (1, 0) in one second.
# At time t == 1, move from room (1, 0) to room (1, 1) in two seconds.
# At time t == 3, move from room (1, 1) to room (1, 2) in one second.
# At time t == 4, move from room (1, 2) to room (1, 3) in two seconds.
# Example 3:

# Input: moveTime = [[0,1],[1,2]]

# Output: 4

# Constraints:

# 2 <= n == moveTime.length <= 750
# 2 <= m == moveTime[i].length <= 750
# 0 <= moveTime[i][j] <= 109
