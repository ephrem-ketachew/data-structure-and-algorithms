# 🧠 Algorithm Arena

Welcome to my **Problem Solving Vault** — a curated log of challenges conquered from **LeetCode** and **Codeforces**.  
This is more than a repo — it's the **arena** where consistency meets curiosity, and where every line of code sharpens the blade for **A2SV** and beyond.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This repository is a collection of my daily problem-solving journey.  
Every solution is written in **Python**, with a focus on:
- ✅ Readability  
- ⚡ Efficiency  
- 💡 Clarity of thought  

I’m not just solving problems — I’m building muscle memory for patterns, learning to think in edge cases, and leveling up for **tech interviews and algorithmic competitions**.

## 🎯 Goals
- 🧱 Build a rock-solid problem-solving habit  
- 🧠 Master key **Data Structures & Algorithms**  
- 🛠️ Prep for **A2SV** and top-tier tech interviews  
- 📚 Leave behind clean, documented code for my future self (and others!)
