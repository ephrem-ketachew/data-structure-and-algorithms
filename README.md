# 🧠 Algorithm Arena

This repository began as a training ground for **A2SV** interviews. Today, it stands as a testament to a deeper passion: the art and science of problem-solving. This is my vault, chronicling a daily commitment to mastering algorithms, data structures, and the elegant logic that binds them.

What started as a goal has become a process. A process I've fallen in love with.

## 🚀 The Philosophy

This is more than a collection of solutions from **LeetCode** and **Codeforces**; it's a library of lessons learned. Each commit tells a story of struggle, breakthrough, and the pursuit of mastery. My approach is centered on three core principles:

-   **🧠 Deep Understanding, Not Just Memorization:** Moving beyond surface-level solutions to truly internalize patterns and principles.
-   **⚡ Performance by Design:** Writing efficient, optimized Python code that respects time and space complexity.
-   **💡 Clean & Deliberate Code:** Crafting solutions that are readable, maintainable, and serve as a clear log of my thought process for my future self and others.
