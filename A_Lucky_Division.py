# Petya loves lucky numbers. Everybody knows that lucky numbers are positive integers whose decimal representation contains only the lucky digits 4 and 7. For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not.

# Petya calls a number almost lucky if it could be evenly divided by some lucky number. Help him find out if the given number n is almost lucky.

# Input
# The single line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number that needs to be checked.

# Output
# In the only line print "YES" (without the quotes), if number n is almost lucky. Otherwise, print "NO" (without the quotes).

# Examples
# InputCopy
# 47
# OutputCopy
# YES
# InputCopy
# 16
# OutputCopy
# YES
# InputCopy
# 78
# OutputCopy
# NO
# Note
# Note that all lucky numbers are almost lucky as any number is evenly divisible by itself.

# In the first sample 47 is a lucky number. In the second sample 16 is divisible by 4.
