# 3816. Lexicographically Smallest String After Deleting Duplicate Characters
# Hard

# You are given a string s that consists of lowercase English letters.

# You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero times):

# Choose any letter that appears at least twice in the current string s and delete any one occurrence.
# Return the lexicographically smallest resulting string that can be formed this way.

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "aaccb"

# Output: "aacb"

# Explanation:

# We can form the strings "acb", "aacb", "accb", and "aaccb". "aacb" is the lexicographically smallest one.

# For example, we can obtain "aacb" by choosing 'c' and deleting its first occurrence.

# Example 2:

# Input: s = "z"

# Output: "z"

# Explanation:

# We cannot perform any operations. The only string we can form is "z".

# Constraints:

# 1 <= s.length <= 105
# s contains lowercase English letters only.
