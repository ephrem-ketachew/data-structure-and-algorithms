# 1684. Count the Number of Consistent Strings
# Easy
# You are given a string allowed consisting of distinct characters and an array of strings words. A string is consistent if all characters in the string appear in the string allowed.

# Return the number of consistent strings in the array words.

# Example 1:

# Input: allowed = "ab", words = ["ad","bd","aaab","baa","badab"]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: Strings "aaab" and "baa" are consistent since they only contain characters 'a' and 'b'.
# Example 2:

# Input: allowed = "abc", words = ["a","b","c","ab","ac","bc","abc"]
# Output: 7
# Explanation: All strings are consistent.
# Example 3:

# Input: allowed = "cad", words = ["cc","acd","b","ba","bac","bad","ac","d"]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: Strings "cc", "acd", "ac", and "d" are consistent.

# Constraints:

# 1 <= words.length <= 104
# 1 <= allowed.length <= 26
# 1 <= words[i].length <= 10
# The characters in allowed are distinct.
# words[i] and allowed contain only lowercase English letters.
